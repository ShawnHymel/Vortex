Vortex is a simple [Tempest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_\(video_game\)) clone where you protect the outer edge of the Vortex. If enemies escape or you get hit, you lose a life. Three extra lives is all you get!

Use your mouse to control the ship and click to shoot. If you are on mobile, a controller overlay will appear: the left thumbstick controls the ship and the right button shoots.

Your objective is to get the high score. There is no end.
